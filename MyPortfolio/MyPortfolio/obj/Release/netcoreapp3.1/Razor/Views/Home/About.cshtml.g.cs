      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I dove into the world of software development, my career was in restaurant management. Most recently, I worked at Pokeworks (you may have heard of it!) as a regional manager for the New York region. My time in restaurants was during an interesting paradigm shift - the rise of convenience delivery options such as UberEats, Grubhub, etc. saw brands refocus many strategies in regards to loyalty retention, profit models, and more. </p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, it increased the potential quantity of revenue inputs and outputs greatly. There was, increasingly, more <dfn class=""keyword"">data</dfn> involved with running and optimizing a sustainable business. We found ourselves partnering with various companies in an attempt to streamline this information, leveraging platforms such as OLO and Punchh in an attempt to consolidate. Desp");
            WriteLiteral(@"ite this, having our store level managers sift through so many different charts and documents to get an accurate model of the business they were managing was inefficient. This led us to <dfn class=""keyword"">data management</dfn> companies, such as Rad.IO so that we could take all the <dfn class=""keyword"">data</dfn> and consolidate it further into a singular dashboard which gave valuable insight into an endless amount of metrics.</p> 
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the while, COVID raged on and we were dramatically impacted by supply-chain shortages. For a Poke brand, where signature dishes most commonly include Salmon and Tuna shipped from the Pacific, associated costs nearly doubled. It became imperitive that everyone paid attention to the supply-chain and proactively adjusted their individual location's strategy to account for potential delays and cost hikes.</p>

The world is very clearly shifting, and at the center of it all is that all so important <dfn class=""keyword"">data</dfn> that drives it. I began looking into ways I could consolidate <dfn class=""keyword"">data</dfn> on my own to help make my store managers more efficient, working with Google <dfn class=""keyword"">data</dfn> Studios and our POS (point of sale) system provider's API. Using that and other information the company had, I not only gained insight into how to manage my businesses more efficiently, but also was surprised by unexpected revelations. For example, a very clear trend in the EBITDA bottom line and staff retention. What could be the reason? I attempted to dive deeper, until at some point I became limited in my technical knowledge of software and was unable to proceed.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was too invested at that point. I knew this was more in-line with my passions, and just weeks after facing my block, I decided to leave m");
