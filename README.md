# Portfolio
 The code to my portfolio website.
 
 This serves as a progress-report on my coding journey. During development, I utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript(JQuery), C#, and ASP.NET to create a page on which I could share my projects to potential recruiters.
 
 Features implemented include:
 
 1. A project page with robust, aesthetic design where recruiters could view my projects and a comprehenive detailed summary of each item.
 2. Page Transitions utilizing Swup (and some asyncronous changes via jQuery)
